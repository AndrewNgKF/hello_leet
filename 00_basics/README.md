# Pattern 0: Basics — Data Structures You Need to Know

Before diving into patterns, make sure you're comfortable with these fundamental data structures. Each file below has:

1. **Explanation** — read the comments to understand the concepts
2. **Working implementation** — study the code, run it, poke at it
3. **"Your Turn" challenges** — mini-exercises with tests at the bottom

Run any file: `ruby 00_basics/linked_list.rb`

## Study Order

| #   | File                    | What You'll Learn                                     | Time   |
| --- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 1   | `arrays_and_hashes.rb`  | Ruby's built-in tools: arrays, hashes, common methods | 20 min |
| 2   | `linked_list.rb`        | Nodes, singly linked list, traversal, insert, delete  | 30 min |
| 3   | `doubly_linked_list.rb` | Doubly linked nodes, bidirectional traversal          | 20 min |
| 4   | `stacks_and_queues.rb`  | LIFO vs FIFO, when to use which, Ruby arrays as both  | 20 min |
| 5   | `binary_tree.rb`        | TreeNode, building trees, all 4 traversals            | 30 min |
| 6   | `heap.rb`               | Min-heap from scratch (Ruby has no built-in!)         | 30 min |
| 7   | `graph.rb`              | Adjacency list, BFS, DFS on graphs                    | 30 min |

## Why These Matter

| Data Structure  | Used In Patterns                                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Arrays & Hashes | Literally everything                                    |
| Linked List     | Fast & Slow Pointers, Linked List Reversal, K-way Merge |
| Stack           | Monotonic Stack, Tree DFS (iterative), Backtracking     |
| Queue           | Tree BFS, Topological Sort                              |
| Binary Tree     | Tree BFS, Tree DFS, Two Heaps                           |
| Heap            | Top K Elements, Two Heaps, K-way Merge                  |
| Graph           | Topological Sort, Union Find, BFS/DFS on grids          |
